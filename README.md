#### Primary Actuators
Each actuator use an `Eagle Power 8308 BLDC` motor mated to a 9:1 planetary gearbox. These come in 2 flavors: `single bearing` and `double bearing`.  

Double bearing actuators handle load perpindicular to the rotation axis better. They are used in joints that rotates on the Z axis. 

Single bearing actuators are used in joints that rotate on the X axis.

Below is an explode animation of each flavor.  They should give you a good idea of the sub components involved and are also a good assembly reference.
