# dARM (dynamic Arm for Robitc Mischief)

## Primary Actuators
These come in 2 flavors, single and double bearing.  

Double bearing actuators handle load perpindicular to the rotation axis better, and they are used in joints that rotates on the Z axis. Single bearing actuators are used in joints that rotate on the X axis.

Below is an explode animation of each flabor.  Theu should give you a good idea of the sub components involved and are also a good assembly reference.
