# Print Files
This project was designed to be printed on 256 x 256 build plate.  

The print files were created for a Bambu X1C and others high speed, high quality consumer printers.

All settings, including build plate specific customizations, are in a profile named `dARM`.  
All plates should be printed in `PLA+`, except the gripper fingers which should be `TPU`.
